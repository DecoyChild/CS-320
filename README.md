One of the top priorities for developing a successful program is ensuring it's secure, functions error free and works as the user expects it to. 
There are many ways to make sure your programs are secure; one is using a maven dependency check plugin. This will check the dependencies used in your
program and check the versions of known bugs. For functional testing, using JUnit and setting up your tests to for 100% coverage is one way to 
ensure its functionality. Apart from validating each component against the users’ requirements. 

It is tough to try and interpret a user’s needs, it is better to get a clear picture of what they are looking to accomplish. That way there 
is no need to interpret, you'll know exactly what they want or need. Though, as projects move along, those needs and wants will likely change. 
From either not understanding the programming capabilities, or an oversight by the user. This is why it is important to test programs in stages. 
This way you are not deviating too far from the original project.

I approach designing software by first getting a mile high view of what is the expected outcome. Starting with the basic, most general requirements. 
I will then get more granular and split the project into smaller manageable programs. This forces me to test in small chunks, instead of trying to 
tackle the entire project in a linear fashion. Apart from the programming, I ask the user a lot of questions to make sure I fully understand thier requirements.
